    "This exercise takes us to the earlier stages of the humanistic data query, namely the design and implementation of a model intended to represent an underlying source (in this case, a photographic collection) for the purposes of answering any queries we might have about this data. Think of this as both exploratory and hypothesis-testing: we'll come up with a generalized idea of how we will model the structured representation of our sources based on some preliminary questions we would have about the photographs' contents; but we will also design that data model so as not to foreclose additional analysis or new questions as we explore the data closely.\n",

    "The Getty has digitized [one of the albums](https://rosettaapp.getty.edu/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE385311) from this collection, allowing us to collectively examine its contents. This is a bound album bringing together photographs from a handful of photographers. According to the finding aid, it is:\n",
